App I made to prove a point

## About
This app uses spotify web API for song searching with the abilitiy to download them as mp3 files. It also uses musixmatch API for getting song lyrics for live rendering.
I made this app in about 35 hours to prove a point.

## Known issues
When downloading some tracks from spotify, the lyrics don't always match with it, because spotify streams even start padding of the song.

## Example
This app is running on [https://listen-anywhere.vikithedev.eu](https://listen-anywhere.vikithedev.eu)
